# Putrescine acts as a signaling metabolite in the transition from nodulation to nitrogen fixation in *Rhizobium phaseoli*


</span>

<div align="justify">

Welcome! This repository contains a series of analysis that provide new insights into the molecular cross-talk between *Phaseolus vulgaris* and *Rhizobium phaseoli*, which is crucial for the development of alternative cropping strategies, including biopesticides and biofertilizers [@syedabrahman_2018]. In addition, we present a transcriptional regulatory network systematically assembled for *Rhizobium phaseoli*, which opens new avenues of research in the relationship between the transcriptional regulation and metabolism of these organisms.

The repository contains the following folders:

-   `1_BBH_TFs`: Contains binary files (.R, .sh. and .py) and formatted files (.tsv) **to identify orthologous genes and orthologous Transcription Factors (TFs)** between *R. phaseoli* and *E. coli*.

-   `2_MotifConservation`: Contains binary files (.R, .sh. and .py) and formatted files (.tsv) **to identify orthologous TFs with conserved motifs** (e.g. DNA-binding region motif) in *R. phaseoli*.

-   `3_TRN`: Contains binary files (.R, .sh. and .py) and formatted files (.tsv) **to assemble a Transcriptional Regulatory Netwotk (TRN) for *R. phaseoli*** from orthologous TFs.
    
-   `4_Evidence_Levels`: Contains binary files (.R, .sh. and .py) and formatted files (.tsv) **to identify TFs regulating genes involved in the symbiosis process**.

-   `5_BBH_PuuR`: Contains binary files (.R, .sh. and .py) and formatted files (.tsv) **to identify orthologous sequences of *R. phaseoli* PuuR in seven bacteria** of the *Hyphomicrobiales* order.

## Pipeline Overview

</span>

\nbsp

<div align="justify">

The pipeline consist of five main steps (**Figure 1**), each one associated with a folder.  First, we identified orthologous TFs based on sequence conservation. Then, identified orthologous TFs with a DNA-binding motif conserved to assemble a TRN. Next, we identified TFs involved in nodulation or nitrogen fixation, being PuuR the most reliable one. Finally, to further support the functional relevance of PuuR in symbiosis we evaluated its conservation among rhizobia and other closely-related bacteria.
